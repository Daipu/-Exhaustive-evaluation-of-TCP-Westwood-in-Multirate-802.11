# Exhaustive-evaluation-of-TCP-Westwood-in-Multirate-802.11

## Course Code: CS821

## Overview

TCP Westwood is a TCP extensions proposed mainly for wireless networks [1]. This project aims to evaluate the performance of TCP Westwood in the presence of Rate Adaptation Algorithms such as ARF, AARF, AARF-CD, ONOE and Minstrel in ns-3.

### Simulation

Exhaustive evaluation of TCPW in multirate 802.11 has been provided in
